# InvisibleItemFramesLite

> Forked from [InvisibleItemFrames](https://github.com/tiffany352/InvisibleItemFrames) by [Tiffany Bennett (Tiffnix)](https://tiffnix.com/contact).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Spigot support will be dropped in `v3.0.0`. The last build to support Spigot is [v2.0.0-beta.7](https://github.com/atlasgong/InvisibleItemFramesLite/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.7), and all subsequent builds will solely support Paper.

A fast, minimal Paper plugin that adds **craftable invisible item frames** to your server; no configuration required, no commands or permissions, just drop it in and go.

## Features

- Adds invisible item frames you can craft and place like normal
- Frames are visible when empty, and automatically turn invisible once an item is added
- Perfect for clean builds, displays, or shops without visual clutter

## Why This Version?

This is an updated, stripped-down fork of the original [InvisibleItemFrames](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/invisible-item-frames.85365/) plugin. Compared to the original:

- Lightweight performance; it's tiny, fast, and focused
- Works right out of the box; no additional configuration is needed
- Compatibility with newer Paper versions (1.21+)
- Plenty of bug fixes

No command trees. No permission spaghetti. Just craftable invisible item frames that feel like they could've been shipped natively with vanilla.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin JAR on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/atlasgong/InvisibleItemFramesLite)
2. Drop the plugin JAR into your `plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server
4. Craft your item frames :)

## Migrating from v2 to v3

Server admins are expected to update their configuration to replace any legacy chat formatting with Adventure's MiniMessage formatting: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format. Alternatively, if you wish, you may simply delete the config file and a fresh one will automatically be generated on the next server restart.
